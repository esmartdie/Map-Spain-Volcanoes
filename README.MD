# Project: Interactive Map of Volcanoes and Population

This project creates an interactive map using the `folium` library in Python to display the location of volcanoes in Spain along with global population data. The map features two layers: one that shows volcanoes with color-coded markers based on elevation, and another that visualizes global population data using a GeoJSON file.

## Technologies and Libraries

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data processing and visualization.
- **Folium**: A Python library used for generating interactive maps. Folium is built on the Leaflet.js library, which allows for easy map customization and layer control.
- **Pandas**: A Python library used for data manipulation and reading CSV files.
- **GeoJSON**: A format for encoding geographical data, used in this project to visualize global population statistics.

## Key Features

- **Volcano Visualization**: The map marks volcanoes in Spain using colored circular markers. Each marker displays the volcanoâ€™s name, location, and elevation. Marker colors change based on the elevation, providing quick insights into altitude variations.
- **Global Population Layer**: The map includes a layer that shows population distribution across countries using color coding. The population data is extracted from a **GeoJSON** file, and countries are colored based on their population size.
- **Interactive Map Controls**: Users can toggle between the volcano and population layers using a built-in layer control, enhancing the interactivity and data exploration.

## Files

- volcanoes_spain.txt: A CSV file containing information about volcanoes in Spain, with the following columns: Latitude, Longitude, Elevation (m), Name, Location.
- world.json: A GeoJSON file containing global population data.
- Map.html: The generated interactive map file.

## Code review

1. Data Loading
Volcano data from Spain is loaded from a CSV file, and the relevant columns are extracted for visualization on the map.

```
    import pandas as pd

    data = pd.read_csv("volcanoes_spain.txt")
    lat = list(data["Latitude"])
    lon = list(data["Longitude"])
    elev = list(data["Elevation (m)"])
    name = list(data["Name"])
    location = list(data["Location"])
```

2. Volcano Markers
Each volcano is marked on the map with a popup containing its name, location, and height. The color_producer function assigns colors to the markers based on the volcano's elevation.

```
    def color_producer(elevation):
        if elevation < 1000:
            return 'green'
        elif 1000 <= elevation < 3000:
            return 'orange'
        else:
            return 'red'
```
3. Adding Volcano Layer
A volcano feature group is created, adding a circular marker for each volcano with a popup showing the information.

```
    fgv = folium.FeatureGroup(name="Volcanoes")

    for lt, ln, el, nm, loc in zip(lat, lon, elev, name, location):
        iframe = folium.IFrame(html=html % (nm, loc, str(el)), width=250, height=150)
        fgv.add_child(folium.CircleMarker(location=[lt, ln], radius=6, popup=folium.Popup(iframe), fill_color=color_producer(el), color='grey', fill_opacity=0.7))
```
4. Adding Population Layer
A population feature group is added, showing countries colored by their population size, based on data from the world.json file.

```
    fgp = folium.FeatureGroup(name="Population")

    fgp.add_child(folium.GeoJson(data=open('world.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8-sig').read(),
                                style_function=lambda x: {'fillColor': 'green' if x['properties']['POP2005'] < 10000000 else
                                                        'orange' if 10000000 <= x['properties']['POP2005'] < 20000000 else 'red'}))
```
5. Building the Map
Both feature groups (volcanoes and population) are added to the map, and a layer control is included to switch between them.

```
    map = folium.Map(location=[41.735462, 1.82837], zoom_start=6, tiles="CartoDB positron")
    map.add_child(fgv)
    map.add_child(fgp)
    map.add_child(folium.LayerControl())
```
6. Saving the Map
Finally, the map is saved as an HTML file.
```
map.save("Map.html")
```
